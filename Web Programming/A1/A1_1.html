		<li>Some definitions:
			<dl>
				<dt>Province</dt>
					<dd>Provinces recieve their power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly called the British North America Act, 1867). The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are dividede between the federal government and the provincial government to exercise exclusively. A hange to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment.</dd>
				<dt>Territory</dt>
					<dd>There are three territories in Canada. Unlike the provinces, the territories of Canada have no inherent sovereignty and have only those powers delegated to them by the federal government. They include all of mainland Canada north of latitude 60Â° north and west of Hudson Bay, as well as most islands north of the Canadian mainland (from those in James Bay to the Canadian Arctic islands). The following table lists the territories in order of precedence (each province has precedence over all the territories, regardless of the date each territory was created).</dd>
